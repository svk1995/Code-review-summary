
	SUMMARY

The Building scene recognition software is unique and will prove
to be very useful to Boston University students. Some issues which
I noticed with the code for this project were firstly, the more 
complicated portions of code were not commented and as a result 
some parts of the code were difficult to understand. Specifically 
I noticed this problem for the code which connects the front end 
and the back end __init.py__ which uses the Flask tool and also 
for the secondpageconnected.js file.
Also, the algorithm could be extended for a larger number of buildings
within the Boston University campus and real time updation of events in
a particular building could be incorporated as is indicated in the user stories.
